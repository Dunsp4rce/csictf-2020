I see all, I read all, but I shall not speak until I am asked to. Ask me, and thou shall recieve.

## Solution

The title has "DIS" in caps, so it had to be a discord flag. The question makes it clear that it had something to do with the bot. On texting the bot for the flag in the channels, it says "Sssssshhh, not here. DM me maybe ;)". On DMing the bot, it prints the flag.

## Flag
