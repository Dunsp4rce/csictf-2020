I made a really complicated math function. Check it out.

`nc chall.csivit.com 30425`

## Files
* [namo.py]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Friends/namo.py)

## Solution
* Go through the given source code to realize that the input entered goes through a set of manipulations
* And to get the flag, the result of manipulations should not be equal to the input number
* It can also be seen that the input should be between 3 and 100
* Running the code locally with different inputs tells us that there is no way to meet the necessary conditions to get the flag by entering a number
* One interesting thing to note is that the input lands inside `float()`<br/>

```python
x = round(float(input()), 0)
```

* Reading up on [float()](https://www.techbeamers.com/python-float-function/), we realize that it takes `nan` as input
* Using `nan` as input, we meet the necessary conditions and `namo.txt` is obtained
* `namo.txt` is basically a `conditional statement-expanded-code-snippet` of the flag written in *namo*
* Flag can be obtained by parsing the file

## Flag
```
csictf{my_n4n_15_4_gr34t_c00k}
```
