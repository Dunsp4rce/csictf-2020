I wanted to send this file to AJ1479 but I did not want anyone else to see what's inside it, so I protected it with a pin.

**Files**
- [panda.zip]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Panda/panda.zip)

## Solution

The given zip file is password protected, which can be cracked using `fcrackzip` or `john`:
```shell
fcrackzip -v -u -D -p rockyou.txt panda.zip
```
The password was `2611`. After extracting the zip file using the password, we got two images, one was the messed up version of the other. On analysing using `xxd`, it was clear that some parts of the original image was replaced in the messed up image (with the flag). A simple Go program which prints the changed bytes (the flag):

```go
package main

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {

	corrupted, err1 := ioutil.ReadFile("panda1.jpg")
	original, err2 := ioutil.ReadFile("panda.jpg")

  if err1 != nil || err2 != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Error loading the files")
  }

	for i, cur := range original {
		if cur != corrupted[i] {
			fmt.Printf("%c", corrupted[i])
		}
	}

	return
}

```

## Flag
```
csictf{kung_fu_p4nd4}
```
