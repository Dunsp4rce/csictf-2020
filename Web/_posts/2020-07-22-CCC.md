You can steal a car if you steal its key.

[http://chall.csivit.com:30215](http://chall.csivit.com:30215)

## Solution
* We are given a complex-looking-fancy website which has numerous dummy links and only 2 useful links
* The useful links are :
	* `/adminNames`
	* `/login`
* `/adminNames` redirects to `/getFile=file=admins` and a file with the following contents is obtained :
	* `csivitu/authorized_users/blob/master/`
	* Going through the above [GitHub repository](https://github.com/csivitu/authorized_users), we realize that it contains the `usernames` of admins and script to retrieve their `ssh-rsa public keys`
* `/login` takes us to a login page :
	* On logging in, we receive a `JWT` in the `HTTP response header`
* Logging in with `admin:admin`, the response `JWT` decodes to (use [JWT.IO](https://jwt.io/)) :<br/>

```
{
  "username": "nqzva",
  "password": "nqzva",
  "admin": "snyfr",
  "iat": 1593506966
}
```

* `nqzva` is the `ROT13` encoding of `admin` and `snyfr` is the `ROT13` encoding of `false` (use [Cryptii](https://cryptii.com/))
* This is a hint that we need to forge the `JWT` token by setting `admin` as `true` along with a valid `username` (in `ROT13` encoded form)
* A valid username can be got from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/csivitu/authorized_users/blob/master/csivit/root) obtained previously
* To get the `key` to sign the `JWT`, we try a bunch of common file names in the path `/getFile?file=<filename>`
* There is also a filename length limit of 7, this tells us that the file name is short and could be even shorter if we are to use `directory traversal`
* Trying `/getFile?file=../.env` (because `node.js app`), we get the `key` used to sign the `JWT` :<br/>

```
JWT_SECRET=Th1sSECr3TMu5TN0Tb3L43KEDEv3RRRRRR!!1
```

* Using the `key` and a valid `username`, we forge the `JWT` and sign it
* Visiting `/admin`, we get an error message :<br/>

```
{"success": false,"message": "Invalid Token, Headers?"}
```

* So we need to send the `JWT` to `/admin` to impersonate an admin
* Sending the `JWT` in `Authorization header` gets us the `ROT13` encoding of the flag<br/>
