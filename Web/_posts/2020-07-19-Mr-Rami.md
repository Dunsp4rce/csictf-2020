## Solution
>It's like an instinct, whenever I see a challenge title related to Mr.Robot series, I check the /robots.txt page. xD

Generally **robots**. **txt file** is a text **file** that tells web **robots** (most often search engines) which pages on your site to crawl. 

So on visiting the /robots.txt, [http://chall.csivit.com:30231/robots.txt](http://chall.csivit.com:30231/robots.txt) we see a path which is disallowed to the web robots. 

```
# Hey there, you're not a robot, yet I see you sniffing through this file.
# SEO you later!
# Now get off my lawn.

Disallow: /fade/to/black
```
We append this disallowed path `/fade/to/black` to the challenge url, [http://chall.csivit.com:30231/fade/to/black](http://chall.csivit.com:30231/fade/to/black) and we get the flag.

## Flag
```
csictf{br0b0t_1s_pr3tty_c00l_1_th1nk}
```
