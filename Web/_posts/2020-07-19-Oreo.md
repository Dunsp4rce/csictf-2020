My nephew is a fussy eater and is only willing to eat chocolate oreo. Any other flavour and he throws a tantrum.

## Solution
```
My nephew is a fussy eater and is only willing to eat chocolate oreo. Any other flavour and he throws a tantrum.
```
The site displays the above message when visited. I reloaded the page and captured the request using Burp Suite and found this.

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Oreo/request.png)

I noticed that there is a cookie called flavour which seems to have a Base64 encoded value `c3RyYXdiZXJyeQ==`. Using an online base64 decoder like [this](https://www.base64decode.org/), I got the decoded value as Strawberry. 

The site says that the nephew only likes chocolate therefore I had an intuition to set the flavour cookie to base64 equivalent of "chocolate". Using the same base64 decoding site, we get `Y2hvY29sYXRl` as base64 encoded text of "chocolate". Now setting the flavour cookie to Y2hvY29sYXRl and sending the request, we get the flag.   

>You don't need to have burpsuite to solve this challenge, although it might be useful in solving higher difficulty problems. A normal browser extension cookie editor will do the job for this challenge.
