If you know, you know; otherwise you might waste a lot of time.

## Solution
```
`<?php  
  
if (isset($_GET['hash'])) {  
if ($_GET['hash'] === "10932435112") {  
die('Not so easy mate.');  
}  
  
$hash = sha1($_GET['hash']);  
$target = sha1(10932435112);  
if($hash == $target) {  
include('flag.php');  
print $flag;  
} else {  
print "csictf{loser}";  
}  
} else {  
show_source(__FILE__);  
}  
  
?>`
```
This PHP code was provided when the above link is visited. PHP's == is notoriously know for type juggling. You can learn more about the vulnerability [here](https://hydrasky.com/network-security/php-string-comparison-vulnerabilities/).
>The baseline is that, == operator in PHP converts strings which look like a number to a number before comparing.

 So, `sha(10932435112) gives 0e07766915004133176347055865026311692244`, which in integer terms is 0^07766915004133176347055865026311692244. We know that == converts anything which looks like integer, so 0^anthing is zero.  Now this value is getting compared to the \$hash variable which is the sha1(\$hash which we send). 

>So we need to find a string whose sha1() produces a hash starting with 0e`

I just googled "sha1 hash starting with 0e". I used this [link](https://github.com/spaze/hashes/blob/master/sha1.md), and took the first string `aaroZmOk`. Sending this data, we get the flag.

## Flag
```
csictf{typ3_juggl1ng_1n_php}
```
