## Solution

Using google image search, we found that this image was posted by [Jack Ma](https://twitter.com/jackma?lang=en). On checking the retweets, a reporter [Sergio Quintana](https://twitter.com/svqjournalist) asked for "where this flight is headed". And his profile says that he lives in San Francisco. So the answer is "san_francisco".
