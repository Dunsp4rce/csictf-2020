'Malcolm X took Broiestevane to a Day of the Dead themed party but she never returned. Her only friends, Mr Bean and the Pink Panther realised that she was missing when she didn't show up for an exam. Broiestevane liked posting pictures, where was the party held? (Don't forget to wrap your answer in csictf{})'

## Solution

Search for the username ```Broiestevane``` in [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock)

```
python3 sherlock Broiestevane
```

The results give us an Instagram link [https://www.instagram.com/Broiestevane/](https://www.instagram.com/Broiestevane/). Opening the link we see that the description has the following text:

```
I cant believe I missed my exam for this party :

```

Opening the link [www.instagram.com/p/B3pJE1CgMvI](www.instagram.com/p/B3pJE1CgMvI) gives us the place where the party was held which is the flag.

## Flag
```
csictf{liberty_hotel}
```
