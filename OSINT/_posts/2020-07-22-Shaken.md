I love this watch. It's been with me all over the world, from Istanbul to Shanghai to Macau.I wear it with suits quite a lot. My boss liked it too. I remember wearing it when she died. What is her successor's name

## Solution

After reading the question 2-3 times, I immediately got the James Bond reference(Huge Fan xD). I know that his boss M died in the movie `Skyfall`. So, searching for M's successor's name in the [Spectre Cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(2015_film)#Cast), I get his name `Gareth Mallory` which is the flag.
