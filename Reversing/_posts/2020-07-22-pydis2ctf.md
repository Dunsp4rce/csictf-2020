I learnt Python in school but I have no clue what this is!

**Files:**
- [`C1cipher`](https://github.com/csivitu/ctf-challenges/blob/master/reversing/pydis2ctf/C1cipher)
- [`C2cipher`](https://github.com/csivitu/ctf-challenges/blob/master/reversing/pydis2ctf/C2cipher)
- [`encodedflag.txt`](https://github.com/csivitu/ctf-challenges/blob/master/reversing/pydis2ctf/encodedflag.txt)

## Solution

The contents of `C1cipher` and `C2cipher` appear to be Python disassembly. Manually converting this to Python code, we would have something like:
```python
def C1cipher(text):
    ret_text = ''
    for i in list(text):
        counter = text.count(i)
        ret_text += chr(2*ord(i) - len(text))
    return ret_text

def C2cipher(inpString):
    xorKey = 'S'
    length = len(inpString)
    for i in range(length):
        inpString = inpString[:i] + chr(ord(inpString[i]) ^ ord(xorKey)) + inpString[i+1:]
    return inpString
```

The first cipher replaces each character `i` in the input text with `chr(2*ord(i) - len(text))`, while the second cipher XORs every character in the input text with `'S'`. To reverse the first cipher, I wrote the following function:

```python
def C1rev(text):
    ret = ''
    for i in text:
        ret += chr((ord(i)+len(text))//2)
    return ret
```
To reverse the second cipher, `xor(inpString, 'S')` is sufficient (`xor` function from the `pwn` library is used). However, only `C1rev` was enough to get the flag; seems like `C2cipher` wasn't used at all.
