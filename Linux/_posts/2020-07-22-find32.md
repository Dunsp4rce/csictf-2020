I should have really named my files better. I thought I've hidden the flag, now I can't find it myself.
(Wrap your flag in csictf{})

```shell
ssh user1@chall.csivit.com -p 30630
Password is find32
```

## Solution

On connecting to the server, we found a lot of random files. The question has the number 32, which is the ASCII of space and spaces in flags are underscores. So we searched for underscores and found a file that had this:
```
csictf{not_the_flag}{user2:AAE976A5232713355D58584CFE5A5}
```
So those were the credentials of `user2`. Logging into user2, we again found a bunch of random files, again searching for underscore, gave the string `th15_15_unu5u41` which had to be the flag.

## Flag

```
csictf{th15_15_unu5u41}
```
