"Cows are following me everywhere I go. Help, I'm trapped!"
```shell
nc chall.csivit.com 30611
```

## Solution

The given nc command connected to a linux shell where most of the commands were aliased with `cowsay`. Instead of fixing the alias, we spawned a  shell using `bash` (which wasn't aliased) and printed the flag.

## Flag

```
csictf{1_4m_cl4rk3_k3nt}
```
